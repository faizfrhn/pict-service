# picture-service

## Description

This picture service is a Micro-Web-Framework Challenge done as part of an assessment for their candidates.  
I chose Sinatra as the framework of choice out of the options given as I have been pretty fascinated by Ruby for some time already, so I gave it a shot.


## Installation

You will need to install the following gems:

```shell
gem install sinatra
gem install puma # or any other server
gem install rack-test
gem install rubyzip
```

## Running the service

Once the gems are all installed, you may run the service with:

```shell
ruby service.rb
```

If you would like to run the test file, you may run it with:

```shell
ruby test/service-test.rb
```
